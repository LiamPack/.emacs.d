;;; ctags.el --- an interface to Exuberant Ctags -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

;; From skeeto!

;;; Commentary:

;; This file doesn't read from a "tags" file, but instead invokes
;; "ctags -x" on demand. Modern computers are plenty fast that only
;; truly gigantic projects really need a "tags" database. Currently it
;; relies on Exuberant Ctags' "-R" option.

;; This package provides one command: M-x `ctags-find'. The suggested
;; binding:

;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-.") #'ctags-find)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-?") #'ctags-find-reference)

;; I haven't bothered implementing a tag stack since I normally rely
;; on Evil's jump list (C-o, C-i).
