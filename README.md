# just another .emacs.d
The emphasis is on internal packages. I rely on the internal
`desktop`, `dabbrev` and `abbrev`, `xref`, `isearch`, etc., and
external `embark`, `consult`, `eglot`, `orderless`,
programming-language specific, etc.. I've gotten a surprising amount
of mileage out of `tempel` for latex (see [templates](templates)).

I've tried the whole bag of shiny packages for completion, navigation,
and all that (`ivy`, `helm`, ...), but I think Emacs has improved the
user experience to the point of obsoletion of these huge hammers. I
have a hard time understanding these over-powered packages, which
makes me less comfortable in my own home.

Just my emacs config. To see the deprecated literate-programming
document form of my configuration, see [config.org](config.org), which
may or may not be out of date now. Lisp and configuration is defined
in [lisp/](lisp/).

We're always standing on the shoulders of giants. The giant I'm
standing on is [protesilaos.com](prot), who has done so much for the
Emacs community in the past half-decade.
