In the past, textbooks were sometimes published as 'interleaved'
editions.  That meant, each page was followed by a blank page and
ambitious students/scholars had the ability to take their notes
directly in their copy of the textbook.  Newton and Kant were
prominent representatives of this technique.

Nowadays textbooks (or lecture material) come in PDF format.  Although almost
every PDF Reader has the ability to add some notes to the PDF itself, it is
not as powerful as it could be.

This is what this minor mode tries to accomplish.  It presents your PDF side by
side to an [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] buffer with your notes, narrowing
down to just those passages that are relevant to the particular page in the
document viewer.
